# Budget Buddy v7.1 — GitHub Pages Ready

**How to publish in ~3 minutes:**

1. Go to https://github.com/new → create a repo (public). Name it `budget-buddy` or similar.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag ALL files from this folder:
   - `index.html`, `transactions.html`, `budgets.html`, `cards.html`, `reports.html`
   - `style.css`, `app.js`, `favicon.svg`, `404.html`, `.nojekyll`, `README.md`
3. **Commit** the upload to the `main` branch.
4. Open **Settings → Pages** → under *Build and deployment*, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, then pick:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**.
5. Wait ~60 seconds. Your site will appear under **Settings → Pages**. It looks like:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### Update the site later
- Edit files locally and upload again (or push commits). The site redeploys automatically.

### Data privacy
- All app data is stored in each visitor’s **browser localStorage** under your domain.

Enjoy!
